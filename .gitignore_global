# Binstubs. I'm not sure I should actually include these in the gitignore. The
# main reason I'm doing it is to avoid a situation where the very first commit
# I make to thoughtbot is adding binstubs. At the same time, I don't want the
# first commit I make to be me changing their gitignore to ignore binstubs. I
# feel like they must have already discussed this at some previous point.
